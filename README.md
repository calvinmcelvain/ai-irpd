# AI-IRPD Project

This project focuses on creating game-theory categories from summaries of instances/cases in an experimental economics game (Indefinitely Repeated Prisoner-Dilemma games (IRPD)) and classifying those summaries into the created categories.

**Note**: This is currently for a working paper. No data or prompts are available at this time. If code is used from this repository, it should cite our paper: "Things Change: Changing Actions and Strategies in Indefinitely Repeated PD Games" (Cooper, Kagel, Qi, McElvain).
